# Alien PewPew

## Premise 
Enemies will spawn in Waves and Player will have to clear the wave to proceed to the next one. Waves loop to the beginning when the user clears all the wave.
Touching the enemy will destroy it but player will take the HP of the enemy as damage.
Player will automatically respawn upon death so it is technically a game that does not end.

## Controls
Right Click for Ranged Attack - Weaker attack but higher range
Left Click for Melee Attack - Stronger attack but lower range
Left Alt for Block - Blocking will lessen the damage, so if block value is 5 and enemy damage is 5, hp loss is 0
Space for Dash - Dashing will make you invunerable
